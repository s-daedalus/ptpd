# ToDo's:
- evaluate port closer to PTPD main branch (v2.2.2)
- better differentiate ptpd clock and timestamping interfecing and ptp hardware abstraction
    - interface definition in ptpd port, hw abstraction in own Project / FreeRTOS + TCP fork
- demangle includes to better indicate dependencies (not one big header file...)
- uniformize naming conventions
- improve buffer handling.
